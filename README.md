# Prediction-Models-Study

This repository contains the files of my second individual project in the field of football analytics. It contains the data set used in the project that is created by web scraping, which is found in the notebook. The only other files are the jupyter notebooks I have written as the final result of the project itself (as ipynb and html files).
